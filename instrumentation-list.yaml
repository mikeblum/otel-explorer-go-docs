    Package opencensus provides a migration bridge from OpenCensus to
    OpenTelemetry for metrics and traces. The bridge incorporates metrics and
    traces from OpenCensus into the OpenTelemetry SDK, combining them with
    metrics and traces from OpenTelemetry instrumentation.

    # Migration Guide

    For most applications, it would be difficult to migrate an application
    from OpenCensus to OpenTelemetry all-at-once. Libraries used by the
    application may still be using OpenCensus, and the application itself may
    have many lines of instrumentation.

    Bridges help in this situation by allowing your application to have "mixed"
    instrumentation, while incorporating all instrumentation into a single
    export path. To migrate with bridges, a user would:

     1. Configure the OpenTelemetry SDK for metrics and traces, with the OpenTelemetry exporters matching to your current OpenCensus exporters.
     2. Install this OpenCensus bridge, which sends OpenCensus telemetry to your new OpenTelemetry exporters.
     3. Over time, migrate your instrumentation from OpenCensus to OpenTelemetry.
     4. Once all instrumentation is migrated, remove the OpenCensus bridge.

    With this approach, you can migrate your telemetry, including in dependent
    libraries over time without disruption.

    # Warnings

    Installing a metric or tracing bridge will cause OpenCensus telemetry to be
    exported by OpenTelemetry exporters. Since OpenCensus telemetry uses globals,
    installing a bridge will result in telemetry collection from _all_ libraries
    that use OpenCensus, including some you may not expect, such as the
    telemetry exporter itself.

    # Limitations

    There are known limitations to the trace bridge:

      - The NewContext method of the OpenCensus Tracer cannot embed an OpenCensus
        Span in a context unless that Span was created by that Tracer.
      - Conversion of custom OpenCensus Samplers to OpenTelemetry is not
        implemented, and an error will be sent to the OpenTelemetry ErrorHandler.

    There are known limitations to the metric bridge:
      - GaugeDistribution-typed metrics are dropped
      - Histogram's SumOfSquaredDeviation field is dropped

    Package opentracing implements a bridge that forwards OpenTracing API
    calls to the OpenTelemetry SDK.

    To use the bridge, first create an OpenTelemetry tracer of
    choice. Then use the NewTracerPair() function to create two tracers
    - one implementing OpenTracing API (BridgeTracer) and one that
    implements the OpenTelemetry API (WrapperTracer) and mostly
    forwards the calls to the OpenTelemetry tracer of choice, but does
    some extra steps to make the interaction between both APIs
    working. If the OpenTelemetry tracer of choice already knows how to
    cooperate with OpenTracing API through the OpenTracing bridge
    (explained in detail below), then it is fine to skip the
    WrapperTracer by calling the NewBridgeTracer() function to get the
    bridge tracer and then passing the chosen OpenTelemetry tracer to
    the SetOpenTelemetryTracer() function of the bridge tracer.

    To use an OpenTelemetry span as the parent of an OpenTracing span,
    create a context using the ContextWithBridgeSpan() function of
    the bridge tracer, and then use the StartSpanFromContext function
    of the OpenTracing API.

    Bridge tracer also allows the user to install a warning handler
    through the SetWarningHandler() function. The warning handler will
    be called when there is some misbehavior of the OpenTelemetry
    tracer with regard to the cooperation with the OpenTracing API.

    For an OpenTelemetry tracer to cooperate with OpenTracing API
    through the BridgeTracer, the OpenTelemetry tracer needs to
    (reasoning is below the list):

    1. Return the same context it received in the Start() function if
    migration.SkipContextSetup() returns true.

    2. Implement the migration.DeferredContextSetupTracerExtension
    interface. The implementation should setup the context it would
    normally do in the Start() function if the
    migration.SkipContextSetup() function returned false. Calling
    ContextWithBridgeSpan() is not necessary.

    3. Have an access to the BridgeTracer instance.

    4. If the migration.SkipContextSetup() function returned false, the
    tracer should use the ContextWithBridgeSpan() function to install the
    created span as an active OpenTracing span.

    There are some differences between OpenTracing and OpenTelemetry
    APIs, especially with regard to Go context handling. When a span is
    created with an OpenTracing API (through the StartSpan() function)
    the Go context is not available. BridgeTracer has access to the
    OpenTelemetry tracer of choice, so in the StartSpan() function
    BridgeTracer translates the parameters to the OpenTelemetry version
    and uses the OpenTelemetry tracer's Start() function to actually
    create a span. The OpenTelemetry Start() function takes the Go
    context as a parameter, so BridgeTracer at this point passes a
    temporary context to Start(). All the changes to the temporary
    context will be lost at the end of the StartSpan() function, so the
    OpenTelemetry tracer of choice should not do anything with the
    context. If the returned context is different, BridgeTracer will
    warn about it. The OpenTelemetry tracer of choice can learn about
    this situation by using the migration.SkipContextSetup()
    function. The tracer will receive an opportunity to set up the
    context at a later stage. Usually after StartSpan() is finished,
    users of the OpenTracing API are calling (either directly or
    through the opentracing.StartSpanFromContext() helper function) the
    opentracing.ContextWithSpan() function to insert the created
    OpenTracing span into the context. At that time, the OpenTelemetry
    tracer of choice has a chance of setting up the context through a
    hook invoked inside the opentracing.ContextWithSpan() function. For
    that to happen, the tracer should implement the
    migration.DeferredContextSetupTracerExtension interface. This so
    far explains the need for points 1. and 2.

    When the span is created with the OpenTelemetry API (with the
    Start() function) then migration.SkipContextSetup() will return
    false. This means that the tracer can do the usual setup of the
    context, but it also should set up the active OpenTracing span in
    the context. This is because OpenTracing API is not used at all in
    the creation of the span, but the OpenTracing API may be used
    during the time when the created OpenTelemetry span is current. For
    this case to work, we need to also set up active OpenTracing span
    in the context. This can be done with the ContextWithBridgeSpan()
    function. This means that the OpenTelemetry tracer of choice needs
    to have an access to the BridgeTracer instance. This should explain
    the need for points 3. and 4.

    Another difference related to the Go context handling is in logging
    - OpenTracing API does not take a context parameter in the
    LogFields() function, so when the call to the function gets
    translated to OpenTelemetry AddEvent() function, an empty context
    is passed.

    Package otlpmetrichttp provides an OTLP metrics exporter using HTTP with protobuf payloads.
    By default the telemetry is sent to https://localhost:4318/v1/metrics.

    Exporter should be created using [New] and used with a [metric.PeriodicReader].

    The environment variables described below can be used for configuration.

    OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT (default: "https://localhost:4318") -
    target base URL ("/v1/metrics" is appended) to which the exporter sends telemetry.
    The value must contain a scheme ("http" or "https") and host.
    The value may additionally contain a port and a path.
    The value should not contain a query string or fragment.
    The configuration can be overridden by OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT
    environment variable and by [WithEndpoint], [WithEndpointURL], and [WithInsecure] options.

    Package otel provides global access to the OpenTelemetry API. The subpackages of
    the otel package provide an implementation of the OpenTelemetry API.

    The provided API is used to instrument code and measure data about that code's
    performance and operation. The measured data, by default, is not processed or
    transmitted anywhere. An implementation of the OpenTelemetry SDK, like the
    default SDK implementation (go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk), and associated
    exporters are used to process and transport this data.

    Package log provides the OpenTelemetry Logs API.

    This API is separate from its implementation so the instrumentation built from
    it is reusable. See [go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/log] for the official
    OpenTelemetry implementation of this API.

    The log package provides the OpenTelemetry Logs API, which serves as a standard
    interface for generating and managing log records within the OpenTelemetry ecosystem.
    This package allows users to emit LogRecords, enabling structured, context-rich logging
    that can be easily integrated with observability tools. It ensures that log data is captured
    in a way that is consistent with OpenTelemetry's data model.

    This package can be used to create bridges between existing logging libraries and OpenTelemetry.
    Log bridges allow integrating the existing logging setups with OpenTelemetry.
    Log bridges can be found in the [registry].

    # API Implementations

    This package does not conform to the standard Go versioning policy, all of its
    interfaces may have methods added to them without a package major version bump.
    This non-standard API evolution could surprise an uninformed implementation
    author. They could unknowingly build their implementation in a way that would
    result in a runtime panic for their users that update to the new API.

    The API is designed to help inform an instrumentation author about this
    non-standard API evolution. It requires them to choose a default behavior for
    unimplemented interface methods. There are three behavior choices they can
    make:

      - Compilation failure
      - Panic
      - Default to another implementation

    All interfaces in this API embed a corresponding interface from
    [go.opentelemetry.io/otel/log/embedded]. If an author wants the default
    behavior of their implementations to be a compilation failure, signaling to
    their users they need to update to the latest version of that implementation,
    they need to embed the corresponding interface from
    [go.opentelemetry.io/otel/log/embedded] in their implementation. For example,

    	import "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/log/embedded"

    	type LoggerProvider struct {
    		embedded.LoggerProvider
    		// ...
    	}

    If an author wants the default behavior of their implementations to a panic,
    they need to embed the API interface directly.

    	import "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/log"

    	type LoggerProvider struct {
    		log.LoggerProvider
    		// ...
    	}

    This is not a recommended behavior as it could lead to publishing packages that
    contain runtime panics when users update other package that use newer versions
    of [go.opentelemetry.io/otel/log].

    Finally, an author can embed another implementation in theirs. The embedded
    implementation will be used for methods not defined by the author. For example,
    an author who wants to default to silently dropping the call can use
    [go.opentelemetry.io/otel/log/noop]:

    	import "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/log/noop"

    	type LoggerProvider struct {
    		noop.LoggerProvider
    		// ...
    	}

    It is strongly recommended that authors only embed
    go.opentelemetry.io/otel/log/noop if they choose this default behavior. That
    implementation is the only one OpenTelemetry authors can guarantee will fully
    implement all the API interfaces when a user updates their API.

    Package metric provides the OpenTelemetry API used to measure metrics about
    source code operation.

    This API is separate from its implementation so the instrumentation built from
    it is reusable. See [go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric] for the official
    OpenTelemetry implementation of this API.

    All measurements made with this package are made via instruments. These
    instruments are created by a [Meter] which itself is created by a
    [MeterProvider]. Applications need to accept a [MeterProvider] implementation
    as a starting point when instrumenting. This can be done directly, or by using
    the OpenTelemetry global MeterProvider via [GetMeterProvider]. Using an
    appropriately named [Meter] from the accepted [MeterProvider], instrumentation
    can then be built from the [Meter]'s instruments.

    # Instruments

    Each instrument is designed to make measurements of a particular type. Broadly,
    all instruments fall into two overlapping logical categories: asynchronous or
    synchronous, and int64 or float64.

    All synchronous instruments ([Int64Counter], [Int64UpDownCounter],
    [Int64Histogram], [Float64Counter], [Float64UpDownCounter], and
    [Float64Histogram]) are used to measure the operation and performance of source
    code during the source code execution. These instruments only make measurements
    when the source code they instrument is run.

    All asynchronous instruments ([Int64ObservableCounter],
    [Int64ObservableUpDownCounter], [Int64ObservableGauge],
    [Float64ObservableCounter], [Float64ObservableUpDownCounter], and
    [Float64ObservableGauge]) are used to measure metrics outside of the execution
    of source code. They are said to make "observations" via a callback function
    called once every measurement collection cycle.

    Each instrument is also grouped by the value type it measures. Either int64 or
    float64. The value being measured will dictate which instrument in these
    categories to use.

    Outside of these two broad categories, instruments are described by the
    function they are designed to serve. All Counters ([Int64Counter],
    [Float64Counter], [Int64ObservableCounter], and [Float64ObservableCounter]) are
    designed to measure values that never decrease in value, but instead only
    incrementally increase in value. UpDownCounters ([Int64UpDownCounter],
    [Float64UpDownCounter], [Int64ObservableUpDownCounter], and
    [Float64ObservableUpDownCounter]) on the other hand, are designed to measure
    values that can increase and decrease. When more information needs to be
    conveyed about all the synchronous measurements made during a collection cycle,
    a Histogram ([Int64Histogram] and [Float64Histogram]) should be used. Finally,
    when just the most recent measurement needs to be conveyed about an
    asynchronous measurement, a Gauge ([Int64ObservableGauge] and
    [Float64ObservableGauge]) should be used.

    See the [OpenTelemetry documentation] for more information about instruments
    and their intended use.

    # Instrument Name

    OpenTelemetry defines an [instrument name syntax] that restricts what
    instrument names are allowed.

    Instrument names should ...

      - Not be empty.
      - Have an alphabetic character as their first letter.
      - Have any letter after the first be an alphanumeric character, ‘_’, ‘.’,
        ‘-’, or ‘/’.
      - Have a maximum length of 255 letters.

    To ensure compatibility with observability platforms, all instruments created
    need to conform to this syntax. Not all implementations of the API will validate
    these names, it is the callers responsibility to ensure compliance.

    # Measurements

    Measurements are made by recording values and information about the values with
    an instrument. How these measurements are recorded depends on the instrument.

    Measurements for synchronous instruments ([Int64Counter], [Int64UpDownCounter],
    [Int64Histogram], [Float64Counter], [Float64UpDownCounter], and
    [Float64Histogram]) are recorded using the instrument methods directly. All
    counter instruments have an Add method that is used to measure an increment
    value, and all histogram instruments have a Record method to measure a data
    point.

    Asynchronous instruments ([Int64ObservableCounter],
    [Int64ObservableUpDownCounter], [Int64ObservableGauge],
    [Float64ObservableCounter], [Float64ObservableUpDownCounter], and
    [Float64ObservableGauge]) record measurements within a callback function. The
    callback is registered with the Meter which ensures the callback is called once
    per collection cycle. A callback can be registered two ways: during the
    instrument's creation using an option, or later using the RegisterCallback
    method of the [Meter] that created the instrument.

    If the following criteria are met, an option ([WithInt64Callback] or
    [WithFloat64Callback]) can be used during the asynchronous instrument's
    creation to register a callback ([Int64Callback] or [Float64Callback],
    respectively):

      - The measurement process is known when the instrument is created
      - Only that instrument will make a measurement within the callback
      - The callback never needs to be unregistered

    If the criteria are not met, use the RegisterCallback method of the [Meter] that
    created the instrument to register a [Callback].

    # API Implementations

    This package does not conform to the standard Go versioning policy, all of its
    interfaces may have methods added to them without a package major version bump.
    This non-standard API evolution could surprise an uninformed implementation
    author. They could unknowingly build their implementation in a way that would

    unimplemented interface methods. There are three behavior choices they can
    make:

      - Compilation failure
      - Panic
      - Default to another implementation

    All interfaces in this API embed a corresponding interface from
    [go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/embedded]. If an author wants the default
    behavior of their implementations to be a compilation failure, signaling to
    their users they need to update to the latest version of that implementation,
    they need to embed the corresponding interface from
    [go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/embedded] in their implementation. For
    example,

    	import "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/embedded"

    	type MeterProvider struct {
    		embedded.MeterProvider
    		// ...
    	}

    If an author wants the default behavior of their implementations to a panic,
    they need to embed the API interface directly.

    	import "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric"

    	type MeterProvider struct {
    		metric.MeterProvider
    		// ...
    	}

    This is not a recommended behavior as it could lead to publishing packages that
    contain runtime panics when users update other package that use newer versions
    of [go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric].

    Finally, an author can embed another implementation in theirs. The embedded

    		// ...
    	}

    It is strongly recommended that authors only embed
    [go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/noop] if they choose this default behavior.
    That implementation is the only one OpenTelemetry authors can guarantee will
    fully implement all the API interfaces when a user updates their API.

    The entry point for the log package is [NewLoggerProvider].
    [LoggerProvider] is the object that all Bridge API calls use to create
    Loggers, and ultimately emit log records.
    Also, it is an object that should be used to
    control the life-cycle (start, flush, and shutdown) of the Logs SDK.

    A LoggerProvider needs to be configured to process the log records, this is

    The log package provides the [BatchProcessor] and [SimpleProcessor]
    that are configured with an [Exporter] implementation which
    exports the log records to given destination. See
    [go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters] for exporters that can be used with these
    Processors.

    The data generated by a LoggerProvider needs to include information about its

    [WithResource], to include this information. This Resource
    should be used to describe the unique runtime environment instrumented code

    make metric measurements. Also, it is an object that should be used to
    control the life-cycle (start, flush, and shutdown) of the SDK.

    A MeterProvider needs to be configured to export the measured data, this is
    done by configuring it with a Reader implementation (using the WithReader
    MeterProviderOption). Readers take two forms: ones that push to an endpoint
    (NewPeriodicReader), and ones that an endpoint pulls from. See
    [go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters] for exporters that can be used as
    or with these Readers.

    Each Reader, when registered with the MeterProvider, can be augmented with a
    View. Views allow users that run OpenTelemetry instrumented code to modify
    the generated data of that instrumentation.

    The data generated by a MeterProvider needs to include information about its
    origin. A MeterProvider needs to be configured with a Resource, using the
    WithResource MeterProviderOption, to include this information. This Resource
    should be used to describe the unique runtime environment instrumented code
    is being run on. That way when multiple instances of the code are collected
    at a single endpoint their origin is decipherable.

    To avoid leaking memory, the SDK returns the same instrument for calls to
    create new instruments with the same Name, Unit, and Description.
    Importantly, callbacks provided using metric.WithFloat64Callback or
    metric.WithInt64Callback will only apply for the first instrument created
    with a given Name, Unit, and Description. Instead, use
    Meter.RegisterCallback and Registration.Unregister to add and remove
    callbacks without leaking memory.

    # Cardinality Limits

    Cardinality refers to the number of unique attributes collected. High cardinality can lead to
    excessive memory usage, increased storage costs, and backend performance issues.

    Currently, the OpenTelemetry Go Metric SDK does not enforce a cardinality limit by default
    (note that this may change in a future release). Use [WithCardinalityLimit] to set the
    cardinality limit as desired.

    New attribute sets are dropped when the cardinality limit is reached. The measurement of
    these sets are aggregated into
    a special attribute set containing attribute.Bool("otel.metric.overflow", true).
    This ensures total metric values (e.g., Sum, Count) remain correct for the
    collection cycle, but information about the specific dropped sets
    is not preserved.

    Recommendations:

      - Set the limit based on the theoretical maximum combinations or expected
        active combinations. The OpenTelemetry Specification recommends a default of 2000.
      - A too high of a limit increases worst-case memory overhead in the SDK and may cause downstream
        issues for databases that cannot handle high cardinality.
      - A too low of a limit causes loss of attribute detail as more data falls into overflow.

    # Ordering and Collection Guarantees

    For performance reasons, the SDK does not guarantee that the order in which
    synchronous measurements are made to the SDK is reflected in the collected
    metric data. This means that even when a single goroutine makes sequential
    synchronous measurements, it is possible for a later measurement to be
    included in the collected metric data when an earlier measurement is not.
    This applies to measurements made to different instruments, or to different
    attribute sets on the same instrument. Sequential measurements made to the
    same instrument and with the same attributes are guaranteed to preserve
    ordering with respect to collection.

    Additionally, the SDK does not guarantee that exemplars are always included
    in the same batch of metric data as the measurement they are associated
    with.

    See [go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric] for more information about
    the metric API.

    Package trace provides an implementation of the tracing part of the

    A Tracer is unique to the instrumentation and is used to create Spans.
    Instrumentation should be designed to accept a TracerProvider from which it
    can create its own unique Tracer. Alternatively, the registered global
    TracerProvider from the go.opentelemetry.io/otel package can be used as

  description: |-
    Package host provides the conventional host metric instruments
    specified by OpenTelemetry.  Host metric events are sometimes
    collected through the OpenTelemetry Collector "hostmetrics"
    receiver running as an agent; this instrumentation is an
    alternative for processes that want to record the same information
    without an agent.

    The metric events produced are listed here with attribute dimensions.

    	Name			Attribute

    Package runtime implements the conventional runtime metrics specified by OpenTelemetry.

    The metric events produced are:

    	go.memory.used          By            Memory used by the Go runtime.
    	go.memory.limit         By            Go runtime memory limit configured by the user, if a limit exists.
    	go.memory.allocated     By            Memory allocated to the heap by the application.
    	go.memory.allocations   {allocation}  Count of allocations to the heap by the application.
    	go.memory.gc.goal       By            Heap size target for the end of the GC cycle.
    	go.goroutine.count      {goroutine}   Count of live goroutines.
    	go.processor.limit      {thread}      The number of OS threads that can execute user-level Go code simultaneously.
    	go.config.gogc          %             Heap size target percentage configured by the user, otherwise 100.

    When the OTEL_GO_X_DEPRECATED_RUNTIME_METRICS environment variable is set to
    true, the following deprecated metrics are produced:

    	runtime.go.cgo.calls         -          Number of cgo calls made by the current process
    	runtime.go.gc.count          -          Number of completed garbage collection cycles
    	runtime.go.gc.pause_ns       (ns)       Amount of nanoseconds in GC stop-the-world pauses
    	runtime.go.gc.pause_total_ns (ns)       Cumulative nanoseconds in GC stop-the-world pauses since the program started
    	runtime.go.goroutines        -          Number of goroutines that currently exist
    	runtime.go.lookups           -          Number of pointer lookups performed by the runtime
    	runtime.go.mem.heap_alloc    (bytes)    Bytes of allocated heap objects
    	runtime.go.mem.heap_idle     (bytes)    Bytes in idle (unused) spans
    	runtime.go.mem.heap_inuse    (bytes)    Bytes in in-use spans
    	runtime.go.mem.heap_objects  -          Number of allocated heap objects
    	runtime.go.mem.heap_released (bytes)    Bytes of idle spans whose physical memory has been returned to the OS
    	runtime.go.mem.heap_sys      (bytes)    Bytes of heap memory obtained from the OS
    	runtime.go.mem.live_objects  -          Number of live objects is the number of cumulative Mallocs - Frees
    	runtime.uptime               (ms)       Milliseconds since application was initialized
